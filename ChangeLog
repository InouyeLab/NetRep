  * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.1.3
  
  * Fixed bug in module data heatmap legends: the range of values present on 
    the legend is now restricted to the range of values present in the data 
    heatmap when the data contains both positive and negative values. Previously
    'plotModule' and 'plotData' would show legends for a range of values centered
    at 0.
    
  * Fixed bug in module data heatmap legends: the range of values shown now respects
    the values passed by the user in the 'dataRange' argument.
    
  * Fixed bug in gradient legends: the axis ticks at the lower or upper end of the
    range specified by the user now have add "<" and ">" to the labels to reflect
    values of that color may be outside the range shown.
    
  * R/plot-functions.R: 'addGradientLegend' now keeps separate track of the range 
    of values present in the data, the range of values to be shown on the legend, 
    and the range of values occupied by the color gradient used in the heatmap.
    
  * R/plot-functions.R: 'addGradientLegend' an axis tick will always be placed at 0
    on the legend if the range of values on the corresponding heatmap can be both 
    negative and positive.

  * R/plot-functions.R: extra argument add to 'plotSquareHeatmap' and 'plotTriangleHeatmap'
    to reflect separation of heatmap legend range from the range of values occupied by
    the color palette used in the heatmap. Calls to these functions from 'plotModule',
    'plotData', 'plotCorrelation', and 'plotNetwork' have been updated accordingly.
    
  * R/plot-module.R: added additional logic to 'plotModule' to separately determine the 
    range of values present in the data, those to be shown on the data heatmap legend, and 
    the range of values the heatmap palette occupies.
    
  * R/plot-topology.R: as above but for the 'plotData' function.

  * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.1.2
  
  * Clarified documentation for "backgroundLabel" argument used in many package
    functions to describe how to disable the behaviour.

  * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.1.1
  
  * R/plot-module.R: Fixed bug where 'plotModule' would crash when attempting 
    to plot a single module where only 1 node was present in the test dataset 
    (e.g. where only 1 of the module's genes is expressed in the test cell-line).
    
  * R/plot-topology.R: Fixed same bug as above for 'plotCorrelation', 
   'plotNetwork', and 'plotData'

  * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.1.0
  
  * R/modulePreservation.R: 'nPerm' argument may now be set to 0 to calculate
    the module preservation statistics across two datasets while skipping 
    the permutation test procedure.
  
  * src/permutations.cpp: reorganised code to return the observed test
    statistics without performing the permutation test procedure when the
    'nPerm' argument in modulePreservation() is set to 0.
    
  * src/permutationsNoData.cpp: reorganised code to return the observed test
    statistics without performing the permutation test procedure when the
    'nPerm' argument in modulePreservation() is set to 0.
    
  * man/modulePreservation.Rd: added description detailing the use case for
    'nPerm=0'.
    
  * man/*: minor changes in all man files due to generation with roxygen 6.0.1
    instead of roxygen 5.0.1.

   * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.0.4
   
   * Restructured and curated documentation: Rd files are no longer generated
     for internal functions, and functions intended to extend basic package 
     usage have been removed from the package manual.

   * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.0.3
   
   * README: updated to reflect publication in Cell Systems and package 
     publication on CRAN (as of version 1.0.2).

   * R/NetRep.R: fixed spelling mistake in package documentation.
   * man/NetRep.Rd: compilation of R/NetRep.R spelling fix.
   
   * R/check-user-input.R: in processInput() improved handling of user input 
     arugments 'modules', 'moduleAssignments', 'backgroundLabel' and 'test'
     to handle cases where user code has overwritten a necessary list element 
     with 'NULL'.
  
   * R/check-user-input.R: numeric labels in 'modules' are now returned as 
     "character", fixing a bug where the incorrect modules would be reported
     in the 'contigency' table list element returned by contigencyTable() in
     R/contingency.R

   * R/contingency.R: fixed bug where ratios returned in the 'propVarsExplained'
     list element by contingencyTable() were greater than 1 due to mismatch in
     in module order of the vectors when calculating the ratios (one ordered 
     as text, one numerically).
     
   * R/contingency.R: improved the 'contingency' table list element returned by 
     contigencyTable() so that it now reports module sizes in their discovery
     datasets, the number of nodes present in the other dataset in the 
     contigency table comparison, and includes modules with no nodes present in
     the other dataset.

   * R/networkProperties.R: in netPropsInternal() improved progress reporting
     messages so that the module discovery dataset is listed as well as the
     dataset in which the module properties are being calculated.
