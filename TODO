Assumptions on User:
---------------------
They will provide their matrices in the big.matrix format.
  - Provide a conversion function?
Diagonals will be set to NA if they don't want them included.
  1. It's semantically better
  2. massively cuts down on the code complexity, thus adds speed.



TODO list:
------------
Implement all statistics
Error checking of input
Restrict network comparison to overlapping nodes only.
Investigate permuting reference vs. permuting test.
Handle adjacency only vs. adjacency+expression.
Handle option for kIMall
