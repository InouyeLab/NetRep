\title{Mean Adjacency of a Network}
\usage{
meanAdj(adjacency, subsetIndices, undirected)
}
\arguments{
\item{adjacency}{Adjacency matrix.}

\item{subsetIndices}{row/column indices in the provided \code{adjacency} that
correspond to the network subset of interest.}

\item{undirected}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, only the lower half of the
symmetric adjacency matrix will be used in the calculations.}
}
\value{
a single numeric value.
}
\description{
The mean adjacency statistic measures how \emph{dense} a network is. It is
simply the average edge weight of the given network, or network subset.
