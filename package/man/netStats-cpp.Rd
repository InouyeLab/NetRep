\title{Calculate the cor.cor and mean.cor}
\usage{
NetStats(pCoexpD, discIndices, pCoexpT, testIndices)
}
\arguments{
\item{pCoexpD,pCoexpT}{SEXP containers for the pointers to the coexpression
matrices for the \emph{discovery} and \emph{test} networks respectively.}

\item{discIndices,testIndices}{indices of the network subset in
  the \emph{discovery} and \emph{test} networks respectively.}
}
\value{
A vector containing:
  \enumerate{
    \item{\emph{cor.cor}:}{
      The correlation between the subset coexpression for both networks.
    }
    \item{\emph{mean.cor}:}{
      The mean correlation density of the network subset.
    }
  }
}
\description{
For some statistics it does not make sense to calculate the necessary
components in advance due to large memory overhead, or logic that doesn't
separate nicely. This function deals with those statistics.
